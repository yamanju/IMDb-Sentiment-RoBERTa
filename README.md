### Project Name ###

Development of a Sentiment Analysis Tool Using Transformer Models

### Introduction ###

Given the availability of a large volume of online review data (Amazon, IMDB, etc.), sentiment analysis becomes increasingly important. In this project, a sentiment classifier is built which evaluates the polarity of a piece of text being either positive or negative.

### Approach

Data Preparation
● Download and prepare your dataset, creating training, validation, and
test splits.

● Perform necessary text preprocessing steps such as tokenization,
padding, and attention mask generation. Model Training

● Choose a pre-trained Transformer model from Hugging Face's library. ● Fine-tune the model on the training dataset for the sentiment
analysis task.

● Experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size,
number of epochs) to find an optimal configuration. Evaluation and Analysis

● Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).

● Analyze the model's predictions to identify patterns in errors or misclassifications.
